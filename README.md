Effect of Allee of the Beddington-Deangelis Predator-Prey Model
This research mainly focuses on the equilibrium points of the Beddington-Deangelis Predator-Prey Model. The MATLAB code is used to solve the system of the differential equation, analyse the behaviour of equilibrium points, and visualize numerical solutions.
